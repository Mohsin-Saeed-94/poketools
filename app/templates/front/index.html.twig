    <h1>What?</h1>
    <p>This is a site dedicated to sharing information about various Pok√®mon games.</p>

    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>
        There are certainly many sites around dedicated to this purpose. However many of them are only accurate to the
        latest version, or aren't organized in a clear manner. This site's goal is to present each game's data as a
        "snapshot" - guaranteed to be accurate to that game when it was released.
