  description: &emerald.description |
    This Pokémon cannot have its [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.
    
    This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, such as the accuracy cut from [fog]{mechanic:fog}; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through []{move:heart-swap}.
    
    Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.
