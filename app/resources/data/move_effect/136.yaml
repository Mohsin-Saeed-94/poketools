  short_description: 'Power and type depend upon user''s IVs.  Power can range from 30 to 70.'
  description: |
    Inflicts [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}.  Power and type are determined by the user's [IV]{mechanic:iv}s.
    
    Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the [IV]{mechanic:iv} for each of [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense}, [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack}, [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, [Defense]{mechanic:defense}, [Attack]{mechanic:attack}, and [HP]{mechanic:hp} in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the [IV]{mechanic:iv} is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} [IV]{mechanic:iv} bit 1, plus 32 * [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} [IV]{mechanic:iv} bit 1, etc.)
    
    Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.
    
    Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the [IV]{mechanic:iv} is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.
    
    Value | Type
    ----: | --------
    0     | []{type:fighting}
    1     | []{type:flying}
    2     | []{type:poison}
    3     | []{type:ground}
    4     | []{type:rock}
    5     | []{type:bug}
    6     | []{type:ghost}
    7     | []{type:steel}
    8     | []{type:fire}
    9     | []{type:water}
    10    | []{type:grass}
    11    | []{type:electric}
    12    | []{type:psychic}
    13    | []{type:ice}
    14    | []{type:dragon}
    15    | []{type:dark}
    
    This move thus cannot be []{type:normal}.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random [IV]{mechanic:iv}s.  However, due to the flooring used here, []{type:bug}, []{type:fighting}, and []{type:grass} appear 5/64 of the time, and []{type:dark} only 1/64 of the time.
