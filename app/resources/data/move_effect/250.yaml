  short_description: 'Scatters poisoned spikes, poisoning opposing Pokémon that switch in.'
  description: |
    Scatters poisoned spikes around the opposing [field]{mechanic:field}, which [poison]{mechanic:poison} opposing Pokémon that enter the [field]{mechanic:field}.  A second layer of these spikes may be laid down, in which case Pokémon will be [badly poison]{mechanic:badly-poison}ed instead.  Pokémon immune to either []{type:ground} moves or being [poison]{mechanic:poison}ed are immune to this effect.  Pokémon otherwise immune to []{type:ground} moves are affected during []{move:gravity}.
    
    If a []{type:poison} Pokémon not immune to []{type:ground} moves enters a [field]{mechanic:field} covered with poisoned spikes, the spikes are removed.
    
    []{move:rapid-spin} will remove this effect from its user's side of the [field]{mechanic:field}.  []{move:defog} will remove this effect from its target's side of the [field]{mechanic:field}.
    
    This move does not trigger []{ability:synchronize}, unless the Pokémon with []{ability:synchronize} was forced to enter the [field]{mechanic:field} by another effect such as []{move:roar}.
    
    Pokémon entering the [field]{mechanic:field} due to []{move:baton-pass} are not affected by this effect.
