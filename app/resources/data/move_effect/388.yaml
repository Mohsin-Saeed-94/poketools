  description: |
    Lowers the target's Attack by one stage.  Heals the user by the target's current Attack, including modifiers, but not including this move's Attack-lowering effect.

    If the target's Attack is already at -6, this move will fail.  In any other situation that would prevent a stat modification, the healing will still succeed.
