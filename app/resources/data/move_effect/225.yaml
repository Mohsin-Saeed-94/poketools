  short_description: 'If target has a berry, inflicts double damage and uses the berry.'
  description: |
    Inflicts [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}.  If the target is holding a berry, this move has double power, and the user takes the berry and uses it immediately.
    
    If the target is holding a []{item:jaboca-berry} or []{item:rowap-berry}, the berry is still removed, but has no effect.
    
    If this move is [super effective]{mechanic:super-effective} and the target is holding a berry that can reduce this move's damage, it will do so, and will not be stolen.
