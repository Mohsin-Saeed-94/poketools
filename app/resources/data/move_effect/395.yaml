  short_description: 'Protects Pokémon on the ground from priority moves and increases the power of their  Psychic moves by 50%.'
  description: |
    Changes the terrain to Psychic Terrain for 5 turns.  Overrides []{move:electric-terrain}, []{move:grassy-terrain}, and []{move:misty-terrain}.
    
    All Pokémon on the ground are immune to moves with priority greater than 0.  (Moves that target the field rather than individual Pokémon, such as []{move:spikes}, are not affected.)  Additionally, when a Pokémon on the ground uses a []{type:psychic}-type move, that move's power is increased to 1.5×.
    
    If a Pokémon is holding a Terrain Extender when creating Psychic Terrain (by any means), the effect lasts for 8 turns instead of 5.
