    Inflicts damage equal to the target's max [HP]{mechanic:hp}.  Ignores [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} and [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} modifiers.  This move's [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} is 30% plus 1% for each level the user is higher than the target.  If the user is a lower level than the target, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.
    
    Because this move inflicts a specific and finite amount of damage, []{move:endure} still prevents the target from fainting.
    
    The effects of []{move:lock-on} and []{move:mind-reader} still apply, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  However, they will not give this move a chance to break through []{move:detect} or []{move:protect}.
