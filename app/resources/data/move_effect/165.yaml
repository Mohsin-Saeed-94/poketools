  short_description: 'Changes the weather to a hailstorm for five turns.'
  description: |
    Changes the weather to hail for five turns, during which non-[]{type:ice} Pokémon are damaged for 1/16 their max [HP]{mechanic:hp} at the end of every turn.

    If the user is holding []{item:icy-rock}, this effect lasts for eight turns.

    []{move:blizzard} has 100% accuracy.  If the target has used []{move:detect} or []{move:protect}, []{move:blizzard} has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.

    []{move:moonlight}, []{move:morning-sun}, and []{move:synthesis} heal only 1/4 of the user's max [HP]{mechanic:hp}.

    Pokémon with []{ability:snow-cloak} are exempt from this effect's damage.
