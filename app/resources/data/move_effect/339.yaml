  short_description: 'Can only be used after the user has eaten a berry.'
  description: |
    Inflicts regular damage.  Can only be used if the user has eaten a berry since the beginning of the battle.
    
    After the user eats a berry, it may use this move any number of times until the end of the battle, even if it switches out.  Eating a held berry, eating a berry via []{move:bug-bite} or []{move:pluck}, or being the target of a [Flung]{move:fling} berry will enable this move.  Feeding a Pok√©mon a berry from the bag or using []{move:natural-gift} will not.
    
    If the trainer chooses this move when it cannot be used, the choice is rejected outright and the trainer must choose another move.
