    Averages the user's unmodified [Attack]{mechanic:attack} with the target's unmodified Attack; the value becomes the unmodified Attack for both Pok√©mon. Unmodified [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} is averaged the same way.
    
    This effect applies before any other persistent changes to unmodified Attack or Special Attack, such as []{ability:flower-gift} during []{move:sunny-day}.
