  short_description: 'Seeds the target, stealing HP from it every turn.'
  description: |
    Plants a seed on the target that [drains]{mechanic:drain} 1/16 of its max [HP]{mechanic:hp} at the end of every turn and heals the user for the amount taken.  Has no effect on []{type:grass} Pokémon.  The seed remains until the target leaves the field.
    
    Because of a bug, if the target is also affected by []{move:toxic}, the HP drained by this move will be increased
    as the damage inflicted by []{move:toxic} increases.

  description: |
    Plants a seed on the target that [drains]{mechanic:drain} 1/8 of its max [HP]{mechanic:hp} at the end of every turn and heals the user for the amount taken.  Has no effect on []{type:grass} Pokémon.  The seed remains until the target leaves the field.
    
    The user takes damage instead of being healed if the target has []{ability:liquid-ooze}.
    
    []{move:rapid-spin} will remove this effect.
    
    This effect is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.
