colosseum: &colosseum
  short_description: 'Deals both []{type:fighting} and []{type:flying}-type damage.'
  description: |
    Inflicts regular damage.  For the purposes of type effectiveness, this move is both []{type:fighting}- and []{type:flying}-type: its final effectiveness is determined by multiplying the effectiveness of each type against each of the target's types.
    
    For all other purposes, this move is pure Fighting-type.  If this move's type is changed, its Fighting typing is overwritten, and its secondary type remains Flying.
    
    If the target has used []{move:minimize} since entering battle, this move has double power and will never miss.
