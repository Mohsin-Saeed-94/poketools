  effect: &ruby-sapphire.effect |
    The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.
    
    If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:sand-stream}, or []{ability:snow-warning} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.
