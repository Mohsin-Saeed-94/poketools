    Damaging moves that would remove this Pokémon's item can still inflict damage against this Pokémon, e.g. []{move:knock-off} or []{move:pluck}.  This Pokémon can still use moves that involve the loss of its own item, e.g. []{move:fling} or []{move:trick}.
    
    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the encounter rate while fishing is increased.
