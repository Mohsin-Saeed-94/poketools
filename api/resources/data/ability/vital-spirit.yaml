    This Pokémon cannot be [asleep]{mechanic:sleep}.
    
    This causes []{move:rest} to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.
    
    This ability functions identically to []{ability:insomnia} in battle.
    
    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.
