ruby-sapphire: &ruby-sapphire
  short_effect: 'Summons a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm} that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.'
  effect: &ruby-sapphire.effect |
    The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.
    
    If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:drought}, or []{ability:snow-warning} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.
    
    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.
