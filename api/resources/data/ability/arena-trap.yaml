    While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  []{type:flying}-type Pokémon and Pokémon in the air, e.g. due to []{ability:levitate} or []{move:magnet-rise}, are unaffected.
    
    Pokémon with []{ability:run-away} can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.
    
    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.
