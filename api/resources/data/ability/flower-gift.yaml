  short_effect: 'Increases friendly Pokémon''s [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} to 1.5× during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.'
  effect: &diamond-pearl.effect |
    Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× their [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight} if any friendly Pokémon has this ability.
    
    Unlike []{ability:forecast}, []{ability:multitype}, and []{ability:zen-mode}, this ability is not tied to its Pokémon's form change; []{pokemon:cherrim} will switch between its forms even if it loses this ability.  As such, this ability also works if obtained by a Pokémon other than Cherrim.
