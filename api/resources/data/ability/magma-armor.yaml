    This Pokémon cannot be [frozen]{mechanic:freezing}.
    
    If a Pokémon is frozen and acquires this ability, it will immediately thaw out; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.
    
    Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its [hatch counter]{mechanic:hatch-counter} decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each [step cycle]{mechanic:step-cycle}, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or []{ability:flame-body}.
