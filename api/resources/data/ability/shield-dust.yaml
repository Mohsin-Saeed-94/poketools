  effect: &ruby-sapphire.effect |
    This Pokémon is immune to the extra effects of moves used against it.
    
    An extra effect is a move's chance, listed as an "effect chance", to inflict a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, cause a [stat change]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, or make the target [flinch]{mechanic:flinching} in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, []{move:thunder-shock}'s [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis} is an extra effect, but []{move:thunder-wave}'s is not, nor are []{move:knock-off}'s item removal and []{move:air-cutter}'s increased [critical hit]{mechanic:critial-hit} rate.
