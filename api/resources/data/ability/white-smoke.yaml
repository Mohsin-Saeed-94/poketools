  effect: &emerald.effect |
    This Pokémon cannot have its stats [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.
    
    This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, such as the [Speed]{mechanic:speed} cut from [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} drop from []{move:overheat}; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the [Attack]{mechanic:attack} boost from []{move:swagger}.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through []{move:guard-swap}, []{move:heart-swap}, or []{move:power-swap}.
    
    This ability functions identically to []{ability:clear-body} in battle.
    
    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved.
