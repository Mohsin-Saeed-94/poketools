  effect: &ruby-sapphire.effect |
    This Pokémon cannot be [asleep]{mechanic:sleep}.
    
    This causes []{move:rest} to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.
    
    This ability functions identically to []{ability:vital-spirit} in battle.
