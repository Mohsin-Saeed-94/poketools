  short_effect: 'Copies the target''s last used move.'
  effect: |
    This move is replaced by the target's last successfully used move, and its PP changes to 5.  If the target hasn't used a move since entering the field, if it tried to use a move this turn and [failed]{mechanic:fail}, or if the user already knows the targeted move, this move will fail.  This effect vanishes when the user leaves the field.
    
    If []{move:chatter}, []{move:metronome}, []{move:mimic}, []{move:sketch}, or []{move:struggle} is selected, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.
    
    This move cannot be copied by []{move:mirror-move}, nor selected by []{move:assist} or []{move:metronome}, nor forced by []{move:encore}.
