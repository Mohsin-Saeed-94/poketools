  description: '[]{move:swift} can hit the user while in the air, and no other moves can.  Due to a bug, if the user fails to carry out the move''s second turn, e.g. due to [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, it remains in the air until it switches out or uses Fly again successfully.  It can act as if it were on the ground in the meantime, but moves still miss it.'
