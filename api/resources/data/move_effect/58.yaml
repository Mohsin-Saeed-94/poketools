  short_effect: 'User becomes a copy of the target until it leaves battle.'
  effect: |
    User copies the target's species, weight, type, [ability]{mechanic:ability}, [calculated stats]{mechanic:calculated-stats} (except [HP]{mechanic:hp}), and moves.  Copied moves will all have 5 [PP]{mechanic:pp} remaining.  [IV]{mechanic:iv}s are copied for the purposes of []{move:hidden-power}, but stats are not recalculated.
    
    []{item:choice-band}, []{item:choice-scarf}, and []{item:choice-specs} stay in effect, and the user must select a new move.
    
    This move cannot be copied by []{move:mirror-move}, nor forced by []{move:encore}.
