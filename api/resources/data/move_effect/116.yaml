  effect: |
    Changes the weather to a sandstorm for five turns.  Pokémon that are not []{type:ground}, []{type:rock}, or []{type:steel} take 1/16 their max [HP]{mechanic:hp} at the end of every turn.  Every []{type:rock} Pokémon's original [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} is raised by 50% for the duration of this effect.
    
    []{move:solar-beam}'s power is halved.
    
    []{move:moonlight}, []{move:morning-sun}, and []{move:synthesis} only heal 1/4 the user's max [HP]{mechanic:hp}.
