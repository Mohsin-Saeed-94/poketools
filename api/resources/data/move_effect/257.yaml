  description: '[]{move:swift} can hit the user while underground, and no other moves can.  Due to a bug, if the user fails to carry out the move''s second turn, e.g. due to [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, it remains underground until it switches out or uses Dig again successfully.  It can act as if it were aboveground in the meantime, but moves still miss it.'
