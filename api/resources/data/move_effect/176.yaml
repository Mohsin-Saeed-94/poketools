  short_effect: 'For the next few turns, the target can only use damaging moves.'
  effect: |
    Target is forced to only use damaging moves for the next 3â€“5 turns, selected at random.  Moves that select other moves not known in advance do not count as damaging.
    
    []{move:assist}, []{move:copycat}, []{move:me-first}, []{move:metronome}, []{move:mirror-move}, and []{move:sleep-talk} do not directly inflict damage and thus may not be used.
    
    []{move:bide}, []{move:counter}, []{move:endeavor}, []{move:metal-burst}, and []{move:mirror-coat} are allowed.
