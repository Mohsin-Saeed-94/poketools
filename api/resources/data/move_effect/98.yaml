  short_effect: 'Randomly uses one of the user''s other three moves.  Only works if the user is sleeping.'
  effect: |
    Only usable if the user is [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}ing.  Randomly selects and uses one of the user's other three moves.  Use of the selected move requires and costs 0 [PP]{mechanic:pp}.
    
    This move will not select []{move:assist}, []{move:bide}, []{move:bounce}, []{move:chatter}, []{move:copycat}, []{move:dig}, []{move:dive}, []{move:fly}, []{move:focus-punch}, []{move:me-first}, []{move:metronome}, []{move:mirror-move}, []{move:shadow-force}, []{move:skull-bash}, []{move:sky-attack}, []{move:sky-drop}, []{move:sleep-talk}, []{move:solar-beam}, []{move:razor-wind}, or []{move:uproar}.
    
    If the selected move requires a recharge turn—i.e., one of []{move:blast-burn}, []{move:frenzy-plant}, []{move:giga-impact}, []{move:hydro-cannon}, []{move:hyper-beam}, []{move:roar-of-time}, or []{move:rock-wrecker}—and the user is still [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}ing next turn, then it's forced to use this move again and pay another [PP]{mechanic:pp} for the recharge turn.
    
    This move cannot be copied by []{move:mirror-move}, nor selected by []{move:assist}, []{move:metronome}, or []{move:sleep-talk}.
