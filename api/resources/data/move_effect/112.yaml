  short_effect: 'Prevents any moves from hitting the user this turn.'
  effect: |
    No moves will hit the user for the remainder of this turn.  If the user is last to act this turn, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.
    
    If the user successfully used []{move:detect}, []{move:endure}, []{move:protect}, []{move:quick-guard}, or []{move:wide-guard} on the last turn, this move has a 50% chance to [fail]{mechanic:fail}.
    
    []{move:lock-on}, []{move:mind-reader}, and []{ability:no-guard} provide a (100 â€“ accuracy)% chance for moves to break through this move.  This does not apply to one-hit KO moves ([]{move:fissure}, []{move:guillotine}, []{move:horn-drill}, and []{move:sheer-cold}); those are always blocked by this move.
    
    []{move:thunder} during []{move:rain-dance} and []{move:blizzard} during []{move:hail} have a 30% chance to break through this move.
    
    The following effects are not prevented by this move:
    
    * []{move:acupressure} from an ally
    * []{move:curse}'s curse effect
    * Delayed damage from []{move:doom-desire} and []{move:future-sight}; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn
    * []{move:feint}, which will also end this move's protection after it hits
    * []{move:imprison}
    * []{move:perish-song}
    * []{move:shadow-force}
    * Moves that merely copy the user, such as []{move:transform} or []{move:psych-up}
    
    This move cannot be selected by []{move:assist} or []{move:metronome}.
